## Creating issues

If you notice a discrepancy between PokeAPI's responses and PokeKotlin's object
models, you should create an issue and I'll fix it as soon as possible. You can
also post questions, feature suggestions, general support issues, or anything
else.

## Submitting changes

Remember to always work in a separate branch, use descriptive commit messages,
and use pull requests to submit your changes. Always create an issue and mention
you're working on something first. Also, make sure that all tests pass. If you
add new fields or types, write the tests to check them against PokeAPI.
